# Software Design 

This is the template for the team project of the Software Design course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Developed a tool for visualizing sport activities exported as GPX specifications using JavaFX. 
The application allows a user to upload their own personal GPX files, and based on the information stored in the files summarize metric information (e.g. total traveled distance, min-max latitude, number of burned calories, weather).
